        <h4>My name is Rafael Alviano Dafito, i'm 21 years old. I grew up in Jakarta and since
            i was Junior High School i already like Computer but haven't knew about programming.
            When i was at High School i discover that the top 10 of the Richest Person in the world are from the Tech Industry,
            and since then it was my dream to become a Tech Entrepreneur, but i never got a real guidence from the people around me.
            Furthermore, i attend UIC college business management but i didn't finish. After that i start my own business which is an online printing for university sudent,
            and that's when i start learn about coding HTML, CSS, and PHP (using Codeigniter) then it fell apart because me and my partner have a diffrent vision about the business.
            I started working freelance, but i knew that if i'm going to be a Tech Entrepreneur i have to learn about coding more, and then i decided that i have to join Hacktivate,
            which i read is the best coding school in Jakarta.
